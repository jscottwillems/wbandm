                <p><b class="company">WB&M</b> got started back in 1981 by Ann and Gene Salge. Originally the business
                    was in the Waterbed and
                    furniture business, hence the acronym, <b>WB&M</b> for Water Beds and More. The More portion has
                    continued
                    in a big way! Gene Salge, a Vietnam War Veteran, was the woodworking mastermind and process
                    improvement specialist that took raw wood into his shop and spit out finished goods. Those goods
                    were then shipped to the retail location where Ann Salge would manage and sell to the public. The
                    first retail location was in the heart of Humble, TX in the old Post Office building on Higgins
                    Street, while the manufacturing location was setup behind the residence of the Salge family in New
                    Caney, TX. Disaster struck the manufacturing plant just before Christmas in 1985 when an electrical
                    fan malfunctioned and caught fire. The entire shop was lost. Perseverance is a Salge trait and was
                    on display as the shop was rebuilt. The Retail location made several moves over the years from the
                    Post Office building over to the old Academy shopping center near the railroad tracks on 1960
                    Bypass. Later in early 90s, the location moved to 1st street near famous Trigg’s Restaurant and
                    then in late 90s it moved to its current location at the corner of 1st Street and Wilson Road. As
                    the Waterbed craze started winding down in the late 80’s and early 90’s, Ann and Gene looked to the
                    future and saw the computer revolution coming. Gene loved being able to design things and have
                    computer controlled devices build, cut, and create new items. He started working on computerized
                    Embroidery. The <q>More</q> in Waterbeds and More took on a new meaning. The Embroidery business
                    started
                    off with 1 machine that Gene and Casey (Ann & Gene’s only son) took to different events and craft
                    shows starting in 1992. Eventually there was enough demand that the Embroidery side of the business
                    debuted in the Retail location in 1994. For over 25+ years, the Salge family has been providing
                    their customers with a superior product at competitive prices. In 2015, Casey and his beautiful
                    bride Carrie, purchased the business from Ann & Gene and continued the legacy that was established
                    in 1981. We welcome you to our location and we are honored to continue offering the MORE in <b>WB&M</b>.
                    With Embroidery and Screen Printing being the most popular services, we also offer banners, thermal
